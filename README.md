# CS253_A3
This Python script performs analysis and prediction on a dataset related to election candidates' education.

### Overview:

1. **Model Selection:** The script employs two models for training: Random Forest and Naive Bayes. These models are chosen for their effectiveness in classification tasks.

2. **Random Forest Grid Search:** For the Random Forest model, a grid search technique is applied to find the best hyperparameters. The optimal number of estimators (trees) is determined to be 1000.

3. **Performance Comparison:** Despite the grid search optimization, the results of the Naive Bayes model outperformed those of the Random Forest model in terms of accuracy and other evaluation metrics.

4. **Data Handling:** The script utilizes Google Drive to load both the training and test datasets. Additionally, the predictions made by the models are saved back to Google Drive for easy access and sharing.

### Kaggle Submissions:

- My Two Final Submissions on Kaggle were my Random Forest Model and Naive-Bayes Model.
